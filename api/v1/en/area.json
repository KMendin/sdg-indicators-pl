EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) The subject of the EU-SILC are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of the European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). StatisticsPoland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: - 1 - for the first adult household member, - 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, - 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14. And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2.1 times as high as that for a 1-person household.",

The household budget survey is conducted using representative method based on random sample which allows generalisation, within a margin of an error, of the results for all households in the country. The monthly rotation of households implemented since 1993 assumes that every month of the year a different group of households participates in the survey.The survey covers one-person and multi-person households. Households of foreigners with permanent or long-lasting residence in Poland and using Polish language also take part in the survey. The purpose of the survey is to enable the analysis of the living standards of the population as well as evaluate the impact of various factors on the living standard and its diversity among basic groups of households. Household budget survey provides detailed information on:   • the level and the structure of expenditures, sources of acquiring goods and services;   • the consumption level of basic food products according to quantity, but also energetic value and nutrients  prices at which households purchase selected goods and services  the level and sources of their incomes;   • household equipment with durables;   •  dwelling conditions  subjective evaluation of the material condition of households;   •  demographic and social structure of the households i.e. the number, age, gender, education, disability and economic activity of the members of the surveyed household. A household is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). The relative poverty threshold is estimated annually by Statistics Poland on the basis of the Household budget survey. Expenditures cover expenditures on consumer goods and services as well as other expenditures:    • Expenditures on consumer goods and services are are allocated to satisfying household's needs. They include products purchased by cash, also using debt or credit card, on credit, received free of charge and natural consumption (consumer goods and services taken from individual farm or own economic activity to satisfy household's needs).

The indicator shows dwelling stocks of a selected territorial unit. Low indicator values indicate a shortage of dwellings, which could result in social problems, such as problems with the emancipation of young people. High indicator values indicate an oversupply of dwellings, the result of which maybe economic difficulties, such as the difficulty of maintaining unused resources. The value of theindicator is also affected by cultural and demographic factors, such as the average number ofchildren per family, the average age and cultural habits of the extended families living together. The data concerning the number of dwellings are derived from censuses and reports on dwellingstocks, on the costs and revenues of maintaining dwelling stocks, on rates of charges in buildingswith dwellings, as well as from reports on housing and communal economy of the community.",
