EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) The subject of the EU-SILC are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of the European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). StatisticsPoland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: - 1 - for the first adult household member, - 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, - 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14. And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2.1 times as high as that for a 1-person household.",

Occupational Therapy Workshops (OTW) support the rehabilitation process of the disabled by developing their skills for everyday functioning, their psychophysical fitness and occupational qualifications. Among the recipients of OTW social services, there are the motorically or mentally retarded with a certificate of significant or moderate degree of disability including recommendation for occupational therapy.",

The indicator shows dwelling stocks of a selected territorial unit. Low indicator values indicate a shortage of dwellings, which could result in social problems, such as problems with the emancipation of young people. High indicator values indicate an oversupply of dwellings, the result of which maybe economic difficulties, such as the difficulty of maintaining unused resources. The value of theindicator is also affected by cultural and demographic factors, such as the average number ofchildren per family, the average age and cultural habits of the extended families living together. The data concerning the number of dwellings are derived from censuses and reports on dwellingstocks, on the costs and revenues of maintaining dwelling stocks, on rates of charges in buildingswith dwellings, as well as from reports on housing and communal economy of the community.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using the continuous observation method (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89, who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The employment rate is the share of employed in a given category in the total population of the same category. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week: 1. performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, 2. had work but did not perform it: • due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work • due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations) • for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their own needs.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using the continuous observation method (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89,  who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective  households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e.performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three maincategories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week:  performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, had work but did not perform it:   due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations) for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months  In accordance with international standards, among employees are also included apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in  the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their own needs.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89 who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. Outside the scope of the survey are members of households staying (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless people. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population. The employed are defined as all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week:  performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed by a public company/institution or private employer,, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture, had work but did not perform it due to:   sickness, or rest leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, parental, paternity or childcare), organization of working time (work system or overtime receipt), job-related training, the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfill work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months - did not exceed 3 months.  According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and unpaid interns, people working in individual agriculture engaged in the production of agricultural products exclusively or primarily for their own consumption. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: - within the reference week were not employed, - were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, - were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed.",
