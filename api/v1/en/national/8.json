It describes high technology section and is mainly used in foreign trade analysis. Classification of the products was created on the basis of the analysis of content of R&D component ('content of technology'). For measurement/ intensification of the R&D intensity the following indicators are used: the ratio of direct R&D costs to the value added, the ratio of direct R&D costs to the production value (sales), the ratio of direct R&D costs extended by indirect costs incorporated in investment goods and intermediate products to the production value (sales). The current list of high technology products includes 9 groups of products whose production requires high expenditures on R&D: aerospace, computers - office machinery, electronics - telecommunications, pharmacy, scientific instruments, electrical machinery, non-electrical machinery, chemistry and armament. Export means shipping abroad the goods that have been produced in the given country. Foreign trade in high technology is one of the methods of estimating the extent to which R&D and solutions produced in the given country are converted to high-tech goods that can be sold on the global market. The following 9 product groups are included in the high technology products according to OECD SITC Rev. 4 list (validated by Eurostat in April 2009): 1. Aerospace (among others helicopters, aeroplanes and other aircraft, spacecraft and spacecraft launch vehicles, propellers and rotors and parts thereof, aeroplane motors, direction finding compasses); 2. Computers - office machinery (among others computers, multifunction office machines);  3. Electronics – telecommunications (among others video apparatus, sound recording or reproducing apparatus operated by coins, bank cards, etc., printed circuits, optical fibre cables, microwave tubes, semiconductor devices; optical media); 4. Pharmacy (among others antibiotics, hormones and their derivatives); 5. Scientific instruments (among others electrodiagnostic apparatus for medicine or surgery and radiological apparatus, dental drill engines, measuring instruments and apparatus, photographic cameras, cinematographic cameras, contact lenses, optical fibres, orthopaedic appliances); 6. Electrical machinery (among others electric sound or visual signaling apparatus, electrical capacitors, fixed, variable or adjustable); 7. Non-electrical machinery (among others gas turbines, nuclear reactors and parts thereof, machinery and apparatus for isotopic separation, machine-tools working by laser or other light or photon beam, lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, machines and apparatus for resistance welding of metal); 8. Chemistry (among others selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, arsenic and boron, silicon, radioactive materials, synthetic organic colouring matter and colour lakes, insecticides, disinfectants); 9. Armament (arms and ammunition).",

During a given period, an enterprise's innovation activities may be of three kinds: successful in having resulted in the implementation of a new innovation; ongoing, work in progress, which has not yet resulted in the implementation of an innovation and abandoned before the implementation of an innovation. Innovation survey is conducted on the basis of international methodology (Oslo Manual). Expenditures incurred on innovation activities in the scope of product and business process innovations include expenditures incurred in a given reporting year. All expenditures on product and business process innovations are taken into consideration in an innovation survey, that is, current and capital expenditures incurred within a reporting period on successful (i.e. having resulted in the implementation of an innovation), ongoing and abandoned activities, irrespective of their source of funding.

Weights of three subindexes were defined during GCI index construction. The main criterion for defining weights is the level of economic development measured by the value of GDP per capita and influence of natural resources extraction on economy. The values of 114 variables included in the GCI index are mainly from annual survey conducted by the World Economic Forum, which is additionally supplemented with data gathered from UN agencies, e.g. UNESCO, WHO, the International Monetary Fund.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture,2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during thatperiod at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers,b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, 2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during that period at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. Among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers, >b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture,2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during thatperiod at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers,b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and ecomically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, 2) had work but did not perform it: a) due to sickness, maternity leave or vacation, b) due to other reasons, but duration of the break in employment: - did not exceed 3 months, - was longer than 3 months in case when these persons were paid employees and received during that period at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers, b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: - within the reference week were not employed, - were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, - were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed.",
