They are divided according to particulates grain sizes into the following classes: • particulates of macroscopic dispersion of the grain from 1 to 1000 µm; • particulates of colloidal dispersion of the grain from 0.001 to 1 µm. Depending on the origin of particulates and fits form, the following division has been assumed: • dispersive particulates, formed in result of mechanical dispersion of solids (e.g. coal dust during coal crushing and grinding in power stations); • condensation particulates, formed in result of condensation and consolidation of vapour of various chemical substances (e.g. soot), general present only in colloidal break-up class. The formation of particulates pollutants is inseparably connected with all the production processes and combustion processes. A large amount of particulates pollutants is particularly produced during combustion of solid fuel.",
