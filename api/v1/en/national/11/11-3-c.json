                        "methodology": " The MAI indicator defines the sum of transport relations between centers/regions, with each relation taking into account both: the travel time between centers/regions A and B and the importance (attractiveness) of these centers/regions in the transport system (demographic and economic potential). Units with a higher value of the indicator are characterized by higher availability.  The indicator is built on the basis of a potential accessibility model, for which the attractiveness of the travel/transport destination (population in passenger transport and population and GDP in freight transport) decreases with increasing travel/transport time.  The value of the indicator depends on changes in the network (transport) and changes in population or GDP. For this reason, there are no adopted maximum MAI values.  There are two versions of the indicator: MAI I  (used in research in 2008 and 2010) anT MAI II. Since 2013, the MAI indicator has been calculated according to the verified methodology (MAI II), which provides full opportunities to study changes in accessibility since Poland's accession to the European Union. The creation of the MAI II indicator was related to the needs of evaluating transport investments financed in 2014–2020, as well as enabling full monitoring of progress in the implementation of strategic documents.  The indicator is based on the potential availability model. In the version of MAI II, poviat was replaced by gmina as the basic unit for which the value of the indicator is measured.  The MAI indicator has no units of measure (it is a feature of potential accessibility). It was assumed that centers with a higher value of the indicator (which in the MAI I model could take a value from 0 to 1, and in the MAI II model can take various positive values) are characterized by higher transport accessibility.  A detailed description of the verified methodology for using the the MAI II indicator is included in the notification 'Estimation of the expected results of intervention using measures of transport accessibility adapted to the needs of strategic and operational documents of the transport perspective 2014–2020 (updated 2020/2021)' at: http://www.ewaluacja.gov.pl",
