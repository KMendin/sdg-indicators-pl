Coastal erosion - a gradual destruction of the seacoast due to various atmospheric factors. Coastal flooding - flooding of the area by seawater, including river estuary streches and coastal lakes. The coastal flooding is most frequently caused by storm wind blowing on the seacoasts in the coast direction. The storm wind hampers outflow of the rivers flowing into the sea, building up water in the river beds and sea lagoons as well as causing seawater intrusion in the estuaries. Coastal Protection Program - a multiannual program conducted pursuant to the Act of 28 March 2003 on the establishment of the multiannual program 'Coastal Protection Program'.",
