Municipal wastewater - residential sewage or the mixture of residential sewage with industrial sewage or rainwater or thaw. Biologically treated wastewater - wastewater treated using specific microflora and microfauna. Chemically treated wastewater - wastewater treated using chemical methods, such as coagulation, absorption using active carbon and other methods, resulting in precipitation of certain soluble chemical compounds or in neutralisation of wastewater. Wastewater treated with increased biogene removal - wastewater treated using technologies allowing for highly efficient removal of nitrogen, phosphorus or nitrogen and phosphorus jointly (biological methods with possible chemical reduction in phosphorus).",
