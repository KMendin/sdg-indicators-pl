A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). To assess the nutritional status of children in developmental age, tables or centile grids of BMI values based on age are used, separate for boys and girls. According to the current WHO definition: - overweight is a disorder where the value of the BMI is equal to or greater than 85 percentile (>=85c) and less than 97 percentile ( - obesity is recognized when the value of the BMI is equal to or greater than the 97 percentile (>=97c). Data comes from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), repeated every 5 years. The results of the study enable to get to know the health situation of the inhabitants of the Union and its conditions in connection with the demographic and social characteristics and the place of residence. The study covers four areas:  health status (including self-assessment of health status, chronic diseases, limitations in functioning and their impact on everyday life, psychological well-being), health care (use of medical care, use of medicines, prophylaxis), health determinants (mainly lifestyle and exposure to adverse environmental factors) and demographic and social characteristics of persons and households.
