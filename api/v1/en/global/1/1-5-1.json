The replacement of the original idnicator (1.5.1 Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon."
