In order to avoid double counting, teachers teaching at different levels of education are allocated to the level at which they work the largest number of hours. Reference year: 2011 includes data for the school year 2010/2011, year - 2012 - data for the school year 2011/2012 etc. Classification according to educational levels was made according to the International Standard Classification of Education ISCED 2011, where:  • ISCED 0: Early childhood education (less than primary for educational attainment) • ISCED 1: Primary education • ISCED 2: Lower secondary education • ISCED 3: Upper secondary education • ISCED 4: Post-secondary non-tertiary education • ISCED 5, 6, 7, 8: Tertiary education  The adopted levels of education correspond to the following levels of ISCED 2011:  - pre-school education - ISCED 0 - primary school - ISCED 1 - junior high school - ISCED 2 - upper secondary school - ISCED 3 ",

Due to the fact that nearly 100% of teachers in Poland are fully qualified, the indicator is no longer calculated. The value for 2020 is the last one published. Employment of a person who does not meet the qualification requirements provided for by the provisions of the education law takes place only in exceptional circumstances. Statistics from the SIO database show that in education levels ISCED 1 (pre-primary) to ISCED 4 (post-secondary), the proportion of teachers with incomplete qualifications is below 2%.",
