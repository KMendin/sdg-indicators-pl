This study covers persons aged 15 and more in households living in the territory of the country. In Poland, children aged 0-14 are also included in the survey. According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) the first question addressed to the respondent in the EHIS survey is self-assessment of health status, i.e. how a person perceives and evaluates his or her own health. In the case of adolescents and adults (aged 15 and over), a response was requested directly from the respondent. For children up to age 15, parents, legal guardians, and relatives may be able to provide information about them. The answer categories used in this question were: very good, good, so so (neither good nor bad), bad and very bad.",

                        "notes": "The presented indicator (4.2.1 Percentage of children under 5 years of age with health subjectively evaluated as very good or good) is a proxy indicator to the one adopted in the official list of indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The replacement of the original indicator (4.2.1 Proportion of children aged 24â€“59 months who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, by sex) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon."
