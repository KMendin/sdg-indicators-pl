                        "methodology": "Data on persons performing unregistered work (used in the numerator when calculating the indicator) come from the representative survey 'Unregistered employment in Poland' conducted as a module to the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The module survey is an additional survey implemented at the same time as the basic survey allowing to extend the scope of information obtained in the basic survey. Since 2017, the observation period of the modular survey 'Unregistered employment in Poland' has covered 12 months of the year (previous editions of the survey covered a period of 9 months, i.e. months from January to September). The extension of the observation period made it possible to assess the scale of the phenomenon throughout the year. Due to the change introduced, the comparability of the time series of data prior to 2017 is limited. In addition, the lack of comparability of the time series for data from 2022 onwards is also affected by methodological changes concerning the definition of the employed person introduced in the basic LFS from Q1 2021. (data on employed persons are used in the denominator when calculating the indicator). Unregistered unemployment is defined as: - employment performed without employment relationship, that is, without a contract, order-agreement, contract for a particular task/work or any other written agreement between the employer and employee, regardless of the ownership sector (also in private households and in private farms) unregistered work cannot be performed on the basis of call, appointment, or election performing unregistered work does not entitle the employee to social security and, by implication, to the right to social benefits the duration of that work is not counted as contribution from the viewpoint of Social Insurance Institution the employer does not allot contribution from the employee's wages and salaries to Social Insurance Institution and Labour Found income taxes are not deducted from income generated through unregistered employment, - self-employment if the concluded economic activity does not meet financial obligations to the state (e.g. taxes).  The employed from 2021 onwards, according to the LFS definition, include all persons aged 15-89 years (previously it was persons aged 15 years and over) who during the survey week: - have been engaged for at least 1 hour in work that generates earnings or income, i.e. have been employed by a public company/institution or private employer, have worked on their own (or leased) farm or have been self-employed outside agriculture, have assisted (without remuneration) in running a family farm or a family business outside agriculture, - had work but did not perform it due to:  • due to illness, or leave of absence, parental leave (maternity, parental, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (working arrangements or receipt of overtime), job-related training, • due to the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfil work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, • for other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration.",

The replacement of the original indicator (8.3.1 Proportion of informal employment in total employment, by sector and sex) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",
