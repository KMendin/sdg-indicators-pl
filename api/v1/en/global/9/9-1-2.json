Road transport of passengers  Road transport of passengers is the total number of passengers carried by scheduled daytime services (according to timetable), special scheduled services (e.g. carriage of employees, to school) and other carriage (e.g. holiday trips) in national and international transport. Data on road transport of passengers do not include transport of persons by buses: of urban public transport enterprises, enterprises carrying out tourist services and transport of persons by buses on own account. The data do not include transport services carried out by entities employing fewer than 9 persons. Air transport of passengers Data concerning air transport of passengers include passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of passengers on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport. Maritime transport of goods Cargo transport in cruises finished with merchant ships, own ferries and ships and ferries hired from other ship-owners. It covers cargo transport in all directions, i.e., cargo delivered into Polish ports from foreign ports, from Polish ports into foreign ports, between foreign ports, between Polish ports. It does not cover transport of goods by ships and ferries chartered to foreign ship-owners. Data on the maritime transport fleet concern ships of the Polish property, joint ownership or share, whatever flag they hoist. The ships of the Polish maritime fleet include ships which are owned by Polish maritime transport enterprises, ships rented from a ship-owner company, whose shareholders are Polish enterprises, and ships owned by companies (with a share of Polish capital) with their seat abroad, which are operated by Polish enterprises. Transport by inland waterway fleet  Data concerning transport by inland waterway fleet refer to the fleet operated by Polish inland waterway transport enterprises (including vessels which are at the disposal of foreign enterprises during the period of navigation break on Polish inland waterway) and, since 2001, also entities whose main activity is different than providing these services. The data concerning carriage of goods by inland waterways do not include small consignments carried by passenger vessels. Air transport of goods  Data concerning air transport of goods include freight and passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of goods on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport.   Railway transport of goods  Data on railway transport of goods include the sum of the gross weight of all commercial and official consignments (i.e. together with the weight of the packages, and in the case of transport in containers together with the weight of the containers) transported in wagons in national and international transport by all types of trains. The data do not cover shunting.   Road transport of goods  Data concerning road transport of goods refer to total road transport, i.e. both for hire or reward and on own account, in public and private sectors. Road transport for hire or reward is understood as providing paid transport services whereas road transport on own account as carriage of goods on own needs, i.e. without payment (calculated into the costs of a business enterprise). In part, these are estimated data.  Pipeline transport of goods  Data on the pipeline transport of goods include crude oil and crude oil products pumped through major pipelines for the domestic demand (including imported) and by transit through the territory of Poland. The amount of crude oil (crude oil products) is the sum of net weights of individual lots of crude oil (products) received to client's tanks upon delivery-acceptance protocols.
