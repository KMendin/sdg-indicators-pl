This is the first Polish strategy document, which directly relates to the issue of adaptation to climate change. The aim of the NAS 2020 is to provide sustainable development and the effective functioning of the economy and society in the face of the risks posed by climate changes. The document indicated the priority directions of adaptation actions that should be taken by 2020 in the most sensitive to climate change areas:  • water management,  • agriculture,  • forestry,  • biodiversity,  • health,  • energy,  • construction and spatial planning,  • urban areas,  • transport,  • mountain areas and coastal zones. NAS 2020 is part of a wider research project called KLIMADA, carried out (in years 2011-2013) on the request of the Ministry of the Environment with funds from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, covering the period up to 2070. NAS 2020 strategy is part of the activities of the European Union in terms of adaptation to climate change, which aims to improve the immunity of the Member States on the current and expected climate change, with a focus on better preparation for extreme climatic and weather conditions and the socio-economic costs reduction. Together with the strategy adopted by the Council of Ministers, the special website klimada.mos.gov.pl was launched. It contains information about mitigation and adaptation to climate change.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %)  15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%).  ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recepients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into bilateral and multilateral. Bilateral assistance is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation. Multilateral assistance is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. The indicator is calculated on the basis of total ODA commitments identified by Rio markers for climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation with assigned scores 1 or 2.  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2016-2020 in accordance with which the focus of Polish developemnt cooperation has been placed on Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) as well as Africa, Asia and Middle East (Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania, Myanmar and Palestine).Polish development cooperation supports strengthening the rule of law, decentralization reforms and combat against corruption as well as human and civil rights compliance. Its main objectives cover the improvement of health care, better access to education and support for entrepreneurship and agriculture as well as natural environment protection including natural disasters prevention. Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator does not cover contributions to the general budgets of organisations, such as UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), which operate within the scope of climate change. Since 2018, the indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there will be no differentiation into net and gross ODA in that respect. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."
