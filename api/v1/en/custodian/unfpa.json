A study at the level of the European Union 'carried out by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (European Union Agency for Fundamental RightThe results of the study were based on interviews with 42 thousand. women aged 18-74 from all 28 EU Member States (1.5 thousand interviews in each Member State). Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

The replacement of the original indicator (5.2.1 Proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15Â years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by form of violence and by age) is due to the inability to obtain data for it.
