EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) The subject of the EU-SILC are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of the European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). StatisticsPoland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: - 1 - for the first adult household member, - 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, - 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14. And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2.1 times as high as that for a 1-person household.",

Programme for International Student Assessment - PISA is internationally coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Ministry of National Education. The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in school and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and its results are generalized to the entire population. The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial. PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: Reading and Interpretation, Mathematics and Scientific literacy. The survey is carried out every three years, since 2000. In each of the subsequent surveys, a particular emphasis is put on the examination of one area, which takes half of the time provided for the student to solve the entire set of tasks. PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means an higher risk of not coping with education and adult life. PISA is one of the most important and the biggest educational surveys, which aims to provide objective and internationally comparable data on the same year students skills.",

The PIAAC study allows for directly measurement of three competencies: • literacy  • numeracy  • ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. In addition, PIAAC provides information about the relationship between skills and intensity of their use, education, educational activity and labor market situation. International Program of Adult Competencies is coordinated internationally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Institute for Educational Research. A representative of the Ministry of National Education represented Poland in a Board of Participating Countries, e.i. in a group that manages the development, implementation and monitoring of the study. In the first round of the PIAAC study (2008-2013) 24 countries were participating, out of which 22 are OECD members. A total of 166 thousand persons aged 16-65 were examined (including 9.4 thousand in Poland). Work on the study concept was undertaken in 2008. In most countries, the study covered the period from August 2011 to March 2012. Publication of results and completion of the first round of PIAAC took place in October 2013. The second round of study (2012-2016) covered 9 further countries and its results were announced in June 2016. Currently, the third round of study (2016-2019) is underway, which will concern the next 6 countries.and its results (international report and datasets) will be published in October 2023. The PIAAC study adopted a contractual scale of competence ranging from 0 to 500 points. This scale has been divided into: • 6 skill levels (1 to 5 and below 1) - in terms of literacy and numeracy • 4 skill levels (1 to 3 and 1 below) - in terms of ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. The higher the level, the better the skill. People with the highest level of understanding of text or mathematical reasoning are assigned 4 or 5 skill levels, and in terms of solving problems in technology-rich environments - level 3. In both cases, people with the weakest results are classified as 1 or less than 1.",

The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

The legislative bodies (i.e constituting) of local government units include gmina council, powiat council and voivodship regional council. Members of these bodies (councilors) are elected for a four-year term. The gmina council is a constituting and controlling body in the gmina.  The executive authority in rural gminas is exercised by a village mayor, in urban and urban-rural gminas - by a mayor, and by a president - in big cities (of over 100,000 residents and in cities in which the executive and managing body was the city president on the day when the act on local self-government came into force, i.e on 27 May 1990 - this concerned cities with more than 50,000 residents and former capitals of voivodships).",

The way that country-wide sample was selected ensured representativeness of the survey results for Poland's population aged 15+ with respect to sex, age and place of residence (locality LAU-1, LAU-2 and voivodship NUTS-2 size). The randomness in respondent selection was ensured thanks to:  • locality sampling in individual classes,  • address sampling (street and number),  • applying the procedure of random route. Locality and address sampling was carried out via Statistics Poland's central catalogue of streets (ULIC), being part of the system of the address identification of streets, real properties, buildings and dwellings (NOBC) (https://bip.stat.gov.pl/dzialalnosc-statystyki-publicznej/rejestr-teryt/zakres-rejestru-teryt/).",

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: 1 - for the first adult household member, 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14.",

For adults over 20 years old, BMI falls into one of the following categories:   18.5 - 24.9 - normal weight, 25.0 - 29.9 - pre-obesity, 30.0 - 34.9 - obesity class I, 35.0 - 39.9 - obesity class II, >=40 - obesity class III.  The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity. BMI was developed as a risk indicator of disease; as BMI increases, so does the risk for some diseases. Some common conditions related to overweight and obesity include: premature death, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes.",

Health of the EU-SILC individual questionnaire). The survey covers adult persons aged 16 and more in a households. EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is the instrument which focuses on providing current and comparable at the Member States level data on income, poverty, social exclusion, living conditions and health state. It is a questionnaire survey carried out every year (with the use of the panel method in the four-year cycle which makes it possible to analyze changes in social phenomena and in the period of time covered by the survey). The organization and methodology of the survey is governed by the Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). EU-SILC survey was implemented in the European Union in the years 2004-2007, and in Poland it has been conducted since 2005. The survey method - EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face interview technique. For individual interviews a proxy interview is allowed with another household member who is able to provide reliable information concerning the person who should be covered by the survey (this is applicable to the household members who are absent in the place of residence at the time of the survey). HLY indicator serves to measure the number of years that a person lives in a healthy condition. It combines information on age-specific mortality (age-specific deaths) and vulnerability to diseases (age-specific proportions of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition). A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in everyday functioning and without disability. This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women. The Healthy Life Years (HLY) indicator is one of European Structural Indicators and refers to health as a factor connected with the development and well-being. HLY indicator has been developed as a result of observation that not all years, defined by expected length of life, are lived in a healthy condition. The HLY indicator level - as other measures of the expected health state - is calculated following the Sullivan method widely used since the 70s. The method is based on measures of frequency of disability in the population of a given age (the self-perceived disability) and on mortality tables.",

Health of the EU-SILC individual questionnaire). The survey covers adult persons aged 16 and more in a households. EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is the instrument which focuses on providing current and comparable at the Member States level data on income, poverty, social exclusion, living conditions and health state. It is a questionnaire survey carried out every year (with the use of the panel method in the four-year cycle which makes it possible to analyze changes in social phenomena and in the period of time covered by the survey).The organization and methodology of the survey is governed by the Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). EU-SILC survey was implemented in the European Union in the years 2004-2007, and in Poland it has been conducted since 2005. The survey method - EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face interview technique. For individual interviews a proxy interview is allowed with another household member who is able to provide reliable information concerning the person who should be covered by the survey (this is applicable to the household members who are absent in the place of residence at the time of the survey). HLY indicator serves to measure the number of years that a person lives in a healthy condition. It combines information on age-specific mortality (age-specific deaths) and vulnerability to diseases (age-specific proportions of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition). A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in everyday functioning and without disability. This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women. The Healthy Life Years (HLY) indicator is one of European Structural Indicators and refers to health as a factor connected with the development and well-being. HLY indicator has been developed as a result of observation that not all years, defined by expected length of life, are lived in a healthy condition. The HLY indicator level - as other measures of the expected health state - is calculated following the Sullivan method widely used since the 70s. The method is based on measures of frequency of disability in the population of a given age (the self-perceived disability) and on mortality tables.",

The indicator is based on the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS). LFS is conducted on a quarterly basis. The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter.The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of  households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity – work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week:  1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture,  2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during that period at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.:  a) employees living in lodging houses for workers,  b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allowspresenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers personsaged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity – work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e.performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree maincategories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. Theemployed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paidemployees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economicactivity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or familyeconomic activity outside agriculture, 2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break incompany activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during thatperiod at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. Among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whomenterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for aparticular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFSdoes not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in theestablishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers, b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture,2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during thatperiod at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers,b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",
